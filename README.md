# Classes in python
- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
## What are Classes?
Classes are essentially blueprints for creating objects with initial values for state (variables) and implementations of behaviour (functions)
## Why
- Classes are used to group attributes and functions for when multiple objects require them.
## 4 pillars
- Inheritance  (When a class derives from another class. Eliminating redundant code)
- Encapsulation (Bundling data and methods that work on data in one unit)
- Abstraction (Displaying only the essential information to the user. Reducing complexity and increasing re-usability)
- Polymorphism (Poly - many Morphism - forms) (The ability for an object to change behaviours or attributes / variables)

Class is the main factor that is used to implement any of these pllars
